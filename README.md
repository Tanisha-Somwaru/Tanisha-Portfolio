# Tanisha's Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my skills and my mission statement as to what I am striving to accomplish in the future as a developer. The programming languages I am proficent are also listed along
with references to email, LinkedIn, and Github for projects and as contact information.

## Technologies Used
Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap to create a simplistic nav-bar along with custom icons and a hero image followed with a cohesive color scheme that creates an aesthetic view. An
organized centered layout is used to display all the images and text.
